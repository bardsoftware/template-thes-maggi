Maggi Memoir Thesis

This template uses the memoir document class to beautifully typeset a thesis. It is suitable for any high-level degree thesis such as for a PhD, Masters or Honors. The layout of the content is in a thin format to promote easy reading and the template features advanced specification of margins and trimming. An example of this is seen in the trimming lines within the preview for this template whereby the stock paper size and the size of the content are independently specified within the template. You can, of course, remove these lines and fit the content to the paper. The thesis boasts a professional look which is immediately obvious from the title page itself and carries through the design of the rest of the document. Three custom fonts are used in the template to match the design and beautifully display your content.

The template includes two chapters, the first is the introduction to the original template author’s thesis and is a useful resource for real examples of text layout. The second is an example chapter which houses practical examples of a number of commonly-used document elements such as figures, tables, code snippets, lists, descriptions, equations, and more. Along with these content chapters, the template includes a bibliography, index, title page, preface, abstract, table of contents/figures/tables/acronyms and a colophon.
